                There is nothing small about the skill set, physical prowess, and impact of the players playing this position
                when it comes to winning basketball games. The Small Forward position packs a <b>versatile all-around</b> bunch who can
                light you up with three pointers and cross you over like a point guard, shoot over or drive past you like an off guard, school you in the post
                with a dreamlike up and under moves like a power forward, and defend the rim and get every single rebound like a Center.
                In other words, you are a <b>generalist</b> and have the <b>ability as well as the responsibility</b> to do it all in the basketball court.

                <h3>Roles and Responsibilities</h3>
            </div>

            <p>
               You are expected to have the skillset of multiple positions when it comes to being a small forward. Whatever it is that
               your team's lineup currently lacks is basically what you will have to offer. Whenever the shooting guard is not pulling his weight
               on offense, you are the <b>second option</b> to go to (unless you also suck) when it comes to scoring. Your <b>skillset and physicality</b> combined allows you to
               drive past your oppponent or shoot over them using your height. From dunks to layups, to freethrow shooting, and three pointers,
               you can be the offensive anchor for you team. As for <b>rebounding</b>, it would be <b>second nature</b> to you especially
               if your Center or Power Forward likes shooting threes and feels like they are a Point Guard. You can go <b>deep in your bag
                    of tricks</b>, maybe with your dribble set, your layup and post play package, and maybe with your passing prominence to win games. You can either follow
                    the lead of the guards in transition, or start it on your own and be a one man wrecking crew due to your speed and size.
            </p>

            <p>
                With that said, there is really not a special responsibility that a small forward covers that cannot be done better than
                those of the other positions. This makes them to be classified as being <b>good enough to handle most things</b> but not really as spectacular
                as the others. However on defense, you can be the <b>main perimeter defender</b>. You can shut down their primary scorer if coach demands you to do so.
                You can soar high for blocks and rebounds, be quick enough to stay on slashing guards, and be mindful enough to anticipate
                play sets and passing lanes of the opposing team.
