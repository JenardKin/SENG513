            <p>  It maybe a team-oriented sport, but in basketball, the team's excellence revolves around so much on the individuals
                    that make up the team. In this website, we will talk basketball, and go in depth on the different positions and archetypes
                    of basketball players that you will see in the <a class="hyperlinks" href="http://nba.com">NBA</a>, the local gym 
                    in schools and the YMCA, and lastly those ones that you see rule in the park.

                    <h3>The Ins and Outs</h3>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Playing basketball is simple. On <b>offense</b> (when you have the ball), you can either dribble, shoot, or pass the
                    ball to a teammate. When you are in a position to do all three actions, you are in what those elementary gym teachers
                    call the <b><i>"Triple Threat"</i></b> position. On <b>defense</b> (when you do not have the ball of course), there are
                    no other positions, you just take away the ball as quickly as you can to go back on offense and score. Just like any other sport,
                    scoring more points than the opposition will make you and your team victorious. <b>Field goals</b> will result in <b>2 points</b> unless they
                    are shot outside of the 3 point line where they count for <b>3 points</b>. 
                    <p>Playing by the rules of the sport however,
                            is the hard part. <a class="hyperlinks" href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=yikes">(yikes!!!!!!!)</a></p>
                </p>

                <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
                    <img src="court.png" alt="Court" height= "100%" width="70%">

                    The game is played on a court which can be on hardwood, concrete, asphalt, snow, you name it.
                    The image above shows the important terms to describe a typical NBA basketball court. It is very informative, thus
                    there is no need to further explain it :). Usually, the team's logo can be found in the center of the court
                    instead of the <b>Pokeball</b> looking shape it has on the image.
                </p>

                    Some rules probably worth mentioning are that you cannot travel with the ball in your possession without dribbling it.
                    If ever you need to <b><i>pick up your dribble</i></b>, you are <b>entitled to two additional steps</b> before you are called for travelling.
                    Oh and no touching the enemy during their attempt to shoot the ball, otherwise you will be called for a <b>shooting foul</b>.
                    If you do however push them when they are not in a shooting motion, you will be called for a (yep you guessed it) <b>non-shooting foul</b>.
                    Shooting fouls and excessive team fouls will result to <b>Free Throws</b> of the ball that count for a point.
