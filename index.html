                    <p>  It maybe a team-oriented sport, but in basketball, the team's excellence revolves around so much on the individuals
                            that make up the team. In this website, we will talk basketball, and go in depth on the different <b>positions and archetypes</b>
                            of basketball players that you will see in the <a class="hyperlinks" target="_blank" href="http://nba.com">NBA</a>, the local gym 
                            in schools and the YMCA, and lastly those ones that you see rule in the park. I will also cover the <b>best player in every position</b>
                            and the <b>greatest to ever hold a basketball</b>. This will look back to the traditional positions of the basketball court as the sport progresses, it is
                            transitioning into a position-less basketball.

                            Playing basketball is simple. On <b>offense</b> (when you have the ball), you can either dribble, shoot, or pass the
                            ball to a teammate. When you are in a position to do all three actions, you are in what those elementary gym teachers
                            call the <b><i>"Triple Threat"</i></b> position. On <b>defense</b> (when you do not have the ball of course), there are
                            no other positions, you just take away the ball as quickly as you can to go back on offense and score. Just like any other sport,
                            scoring more points than the opposition will make you and your team victorious. <b>Field goals</b> will result in <b>2 points</b> unless they
                            are shot outside of the 3 point line where they count for <b>3 points</b>. 
                            <p>Playing by the rules of the sport however,
                                    is the hard part. <a class="hyperlinks" target="_blank" href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=yikes">(yikes!!!!!!!)</a></p>

                            The game is played on a court which can be on hardwood, concrete, asphalt, snow, you name it. Organized basketball teams
                            usually consists of 15 players in total and during a game, <b>only 5 players</b> can participate on the court. Other players can then
                            substitute for those five as there are <b>12 minute quarters</b> played in each game.
                            The image above shows the important terms to describe a typical NBA basketball court. It is very informative, thus
                            there is no need to further explain it :). Usually, the team's logo can be found in the center of the court
                            instead of the <b>Pokeball</b> looking shape it has on the image.
                        </p>
        
                        <p>
                            Some rules probably worth mentioning are that you cannot travel with the ball in your possession without dribbling it.
                            If ever you need to <b><i>pick up your dribble</i></b>, you are <b>entitled to two additional steps</b> before you are called for travelling.
                            Oh and no touching the enemy during their attempt to shoot the ball, otherwise you will be called for a <b>shooting foul</b>.
                            If you do however push them when they are not in a shooting motion, you will be called for a (yep you guessed it) <b>non-shooting foul</b>.
                            Shooting fouls and excessive team fouls will result to <b>Free Throws</b> of the ball that count for a point.

                            With that being said, since this is long enough, lets now dive into the different positions that basketball players can have on the court.
                            Their roles, attitude, and main responsibilities (although it may vary per team) are:
                            <ol>
                                <li><a class="ol" href="pointguard.html">Point Guard</a>&nbsp - first one to touch the ball, first one back on defense</li>
                                <li><a class="ol" href="offguard.html">Off Guard</a>&nbsp - "Give me the ball, get out of my way and play defense"</li>
                                <li><a class="ol" href="smallforward.html">Small Forward</a>&nbsp - versatile, can play D, can play O against multiple positions</li>
                                <li><a class="ol" href="powerforward.html">Power Forward</a>&nbsp - just runs up and down the court, occassionally touches the ball</li>
                                <li><a class="ol" href="center.html">Center</a>&nbsp - protects the paint, gets rebounds, and starts the fastbreak</li>
                            </ol>
                        </p>
