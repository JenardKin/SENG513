                        This position houses some of the most skilled players to ever play the game.
                        With the breath taking <b>handles</b>, the dead eye <b>marksmanship</b>, the lightning quick <b>hesitations</b>,
                        and the <b>threading-the-needle</b> passes, the point guard position usually is the most exciting
                        position to watch as they are often the <b>most relatable</b> to the majority of the people watching, seemingly
                        due to them being the <b>smallest</b> out of all the positions played. It was my position when I played in High School
                        but I certainly was not exciting to watch so I set out to be a Software Engineer instead. Nevertheless, their role is pivotal to the team's success.

                        <h3>Roles and Responsibilities</h3>
                    </div>
        
                    <p>
                        You are most likely <b>the best at handling the ball</b> in your lineup so it will be in your hands most of the time (may vary).
                        You can do a left-to-right <b>crossover</b>, a right-to-left <b>behind the back</b>, an <b>in and out</b> dribble in transition, <a class="hyperlinks" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_moves#Pro-hop_euro_step">a Pro-hop euro step</a>,
                        a <b>step-back pull up turnaround fadeaway jumper with peanut butter jelly on the top</b>. These are the moves up in your arsenal and you are not afraid to use them.
                        There are also game plans and sets drawn out by each team to score and defend easier. Your job as the main ball handler is to
                        make sure they are executed well. Communicating and <b>assisting</b> your team members to remember where they are supposed to be is a responsibility
                        that all point guards must fulfill.<b> Failure to find an opportunity</b> for your team to score in the half court setting, or in transition, will be on you (well if your team sucks,
                        you cant do much) and will result in your <b>coach yelling at your ear</b>.
        
                    </p>
        
                    <p>
                        Since on average, they are the smallest ones on the court, they tend to stay around the perimeter and away from
                        the basket. If you are <b>as quick as lightning, can bulldoze through multiple defenders or have a 48 inch vertical jump</b>, then by all means, drive the ball
                        to the hoop, no one is stopping you. Im just saying that you will get blocked amongst the tall <a class="hyperlinks" href="center.html">Centers</a> if you don't.
                        Thus, the best way to score would be to shoot behind the three point line just like Stephen Curry.

                                <h3>Best Point Guard in My Opinion</h3>
                            </div>
            
                        <p>
                           <b>Stephen Curry</b> might have been the cover picture that I used in this page but that is because it had <b>the best
                                quality</b> out of all that I found. Obviously it is <a class="hyperlinks" target="_blank" href="https://media1.tenor.com/images/d7ebeb4df1190d71bbf291ddc1e487e3/tenor.gif?itemid=5594998">Kyrie Irving</a>, I mean
                                is that even a question. Can shoot from anywhere in the court, has handles that will just freeze defenders, can finish around the
                                basket with the best of them, can somewhat defend?, maybe not. On transition, he will hit you with an alley-oop pass, very intelligent 
                                coming out of Duke University, and one of the people who brought a NBA championship to the Cleveland Cavaliers back in 2016.
                                He also believes that the Earth is Flat lul.
