                Just as it says above, this position is all about offense. Usually you are the first scoring option
                every time down the court. You got a sick handle, you a got a high vertical, and on top of it a barrage
                of ways and "techniques" to score the basketball and lead your team to victory. Typically, players in this 
                position follow the <a class="hyperlinks" target="_blank" href="https://pics.me.me/wish-akers-42-points-o-assists-ig-lakersfans16-thats-my-39829816.png">"Mamba Mentality"</a>.

                Not much to say about this position really. <b> Scoring</b> is your primary responsibility. Every time down the court,
                you hog the ball, treat your teammates as if they are lamp posts in the corner, tell them to get out of your way
                and <b>play offense by yourself 1 vs. 5</b>. It does not really get better than that for an off guard when you can spend
                48 minutes per game playing on offense. If you end up getting an <b>assist</b>, you look at it as, that could have been
                <b>one more shot that you failed to take and score</b>. You also run the transition game with the Point Guard on a defensive rebound.
                Thus, with that mindset, hopefully your team carries the load on
                defense as <b>you will not be doing much on that end</b>.

            </p>

            <p>
                On defense you are literally a <b>bystander</b>. You are one and in sync with the audience, <b>ball watching</b> instead of 
                trying to guard your check. On rare occassions, maybe when your team is <b>down by 30 points</b> with no time left, is <b>usually when
                you start defending</b>. You would need to save as much energy as possible to play offense by yourself 1 vs. 5.

                   It is not Michael Jordan, not Kobe Bryant, but it is my main man "Born Ready" a.k.a. Lance Stephenson, New York's High School leading scorer.
