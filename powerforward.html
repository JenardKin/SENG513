                The description above pretty much says it all, you barely touch the ball. I have really not cared much for this
                position, nor will I start caring for this position, or ever play this position but they are just basically <b>Mini-Centers</b>
                and <b>Big Forwards</b>.

            <p>
               You athleticism combined with your speed allows you to outrebound opposing frontcourt players by outhustling Centers and outsizing
               Small Forwards. Your skillset can range from dominating the paint area around the basket and being able to stretch out the defense
               and spread out the offense by becoming an outside shooter for the team. This provides more space for driving lanes of forwards and guards
               who can attack the basket far better than you do. If you are good at scoring, they will pass you the ball when you are in a position to score
               or during a mismatch. However, usually, the main responsibility of this position is to be the secondary help defender in the painted
               area by assisting the center.
            </p>

            <p>
                I should have more about this position but really they are there to set screens, defend, rebound, and occasionally score.
                Nowadays, Small Forwards fill this position since it is so useless.

                   I dont really have a best power forward in mind so for the purpose of this section, I will give a list of players that played the
                   Power Forward position along with their stats in a table that is nicely styled!
