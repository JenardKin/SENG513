                <h3>Basketball Accomplishments</h3>
            </div>

            <p>
                The NBA is has been around ever since 1946. June of 2019 marks the 73rd year of the NBA league. Basketball itself has been around for 127 years.
                So it is safe to say, a lot of people played it already, both in the professional level and the amateur level. Historically, the best team with
                the most athletic and skilled individuals come out as champions in basketball. These players train themselves throughout the course of their career,
                they get coached by multitude of people, and play alongside other great individuals. Enter the 18 year old Lebron James, straight out of High School,
                being deemed as <b>"The Chosen One"</b> for being great at basketball without any professional background from his parents or his coaches. His Dad was 
                <b>in and out of prison</b>, and he was <b>raised by a single parent</b> who had troubles raising him as a child. Come into the NBA, rookies usually tend to struggle
                in their early years trying to adjust to the new environment. Even <b>James struggled a bit</b>, however in 2007, a <b>undermanned Cleveland Cavaliers team</b>
                led by a rookie coach, with no other All-Star in the team than James, <b>made it to the NBA finals</b>. He simply crushed the opposing teams to get there
                but only to lose to the San Antonio Spurs in a 0-4 series. Although a sweep, he still single-handedly brought his team to the NBA Finals which is quite
                a feat for the 21 year old James at that time.
            </p>

            <p>
               He then moved to the Miami Heat to <b>play alongside Dwyane Wade</b>, another hall of fame All-Star off guard during the summer of 2010.
               The <b>basketball world hated him</b> for his decision as it was a move saying that he was <b>not good enough to win</b> and lead a team by himself.
               They would eventually win back-to-back championships during their time there but the public did not consider those as major accomplishments
               as he needed to go to a "super-team" to do so. He was hated by the people of Cleveland for leaving the team, a place he considered home as he was born and grew
               up there. Despite the resentment of the people, <b>James still decided to come back to Cleveland</b> during the summer of 2014, with the goal of winning a championship
               for his hometown. All doubters and naysayers were silenced when <b>he delivered Cleveland Cavaliers their 1st NBA Championship in franchise history</b>
               defeating the Golden State Warriors in the NBA Finals of 2016 after being down 3 games to 1 in the series alongside Kyrie Irving, J.R. Smith, Kevin Love, and Tristan Thompson. 
            </p>

            <p> Throughout the series, he averaged these numbers as shown in the table below.</p>

            <p>
                Lebron James became the first player in the history of the game to <b>lead both teams</b>, yes both Golden State Warriors and
                the Cleveland Cavaliers, in <b>Points</b>, <b>Rebounds</b>, <b>Assists</b>, <b>Steals</b>, and <b>Blocks</b>. Those categories are pretty much what matters
                in the stats column in this sport.

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>

            <p>
                Obviously, his basketball accomplishments are already eye opening. But it does not stop there, he recently had a <b>Twitter feud</b> with President
                <b>Donald Trump</b> when he spoke out his political opinions to the public. This dude also <b>opened a school</b> called the "<a class="hyperlinks" target="_blank" href="http://www.lebronjamesfamilyfoundation.org/page/ipromiseschool">I Promise School</a>" for the children of
                Akron, Ohio which guarantees free college tuition to graduates if they are able to maintain a certain GPA throughout their studies.
                He has a net worth of 500 million dollars as of 2019 and owns or is a shareholder for multiple businesses such as <b>MLB teams</b>, soccer teams, <b>Blaze Pizza</b>, production company
                called "<b>SpringHill Entertainment</b>", and media company "<b>Uninterrupted</b>". But for me, the reason why he is the G.O.A.T. is simply because
                he overcame the odds that were stacked against him from the day he was born. Once he reached the NBA, he did not just stop there.
                He put himself within the discussion of being the greatest player to play the game and eventually over took the title in the eyes of many from
                Michael Jordan, star of the initial movie <b>Space Jam</b>. His life is just a testament that hard work pays off no matter what you do in life and how much the odds are stacked against you.
